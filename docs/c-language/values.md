# Values

**ANSI 3.1.2.5** The representations and sets of values of the various types of floating-point numbers

The **`float`** type contains 32 bits: 1 for the sign, 8 for the exponent, and 23 for the mantissa. Its range is +/- 3.4E38 with at least 7 digits of precision.

The **`double`** type contains 64 bits: 1 for the sign, 11 for the exponent, and 52 for the mantissa. Its range is +/- 1.7E308 with at least 15 digits of precision.

The **`long double`** type is distinct, but has the same representation as type **`double`** in the Microsoft C compiler.
