# Adding an MFC Class

To add classes derived from Microsoft Foundation Class (MFC) library classes to your project, use the **Add Class** button in [Class Wizard](mfc-class-wizard.md). Specify the name of the new class, select the base class, and select the ID of the dialog box with which it is associated (if any). The wizard creates a header file and an implementation file and adds them to your project.

> [!NOTE]
> You can add MFC classes to an ATL COM application if you initially [created the application with MFC support](../../atl/reference/mfc-support-in-atl-projects.md). You can also add MFC classes to Win32 projects that have MFC support.

### To add an MFC class to your project

From Class View, right-click the project name. Click **Class Wizard** and then click **Add Class** to open the [Add MFC Class](mfc-add-class-wizard.md) dialog box. Use **Class Wizard** to add message handlers or new methods.
