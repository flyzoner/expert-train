# OLE Automation Classes

These classes support automation clients (applications that control other applications). Automation servers (applications that can be controlled by other applications) are supported through [dispatch maps](reference/dispatch-maps.md).

[COleDispatchDriver](reference/coledispatchdriver-class.md)<br/>
Used to call automation servers from your automation client. When adding a class, this class is used to create type-safe classes for automation servers that provide a type library.

[COleDispatchException](reference/coledispatchexception-class.md)<br/>
An exception resulting from an error during OLE automation. Automation exceptions are thrown by automation servers and caught by automation clients.
