# OLE DB Classes

The OLE DB support in MFC currently consists of the class [COLEDBRecordView](reference/coledbrecordview-class.md). `COleDBRecordView` displays database records in controls, through a form view directly connected to a [CRowset](../data/oledb/crowset-class.md) object. For more information about the OLE DB consumer templates, see [List of OLE DB Consumer Templates](../data/oledb/ole-db-consumer-templates-reference.md).
