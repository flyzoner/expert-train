# Scrolling, Arranging, Sorting, and Finding in List Controls

List controls ([CListCtrl](../mfc/reference/clistctrl-class.md)) are scrollable by default. For more information, see [Scroll Position](/windows/win32/Controls/using-list-view-controls) in the Windows SDK and the [Scroll](../mfc/reference/clistctrl-class.md#scroll) member function.

You can call `CListCtrl` member functions to arrange list items in the control, sort items, and find particular items. For more information, see [Using ListView Controls](/windows/win32/Controls/using-list-view-controls) in the Windows SDK and the [CListCtrl](../mfc/reference/clistctrl-class.md) members [Arrange](../mfc/reference/clistctrl-class.md#arrange), [SortItems](../mfc/reference/clistctrl-class.md#sortitems), and [FindItem](../mfc/reference/clistctrl-class.md#finditem).
