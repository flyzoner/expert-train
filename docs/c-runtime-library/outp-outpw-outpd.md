# outp, outpw, _outp, _outpw, _outpd

Outputs, at a port, a byte (`outp`, `_outp`), a word (`outpw`, `_outpw`), or a double word (`_outpd`).

> [!IMPORTANT]
> These functions are obsolete. Beginning in Visual Studio 2015, they are not available in the CRT.\
> This API cannot be used in applications that execute in the Windows Runtime. For more information, see [CRT functions not supported in Universal Windows Platform apps](../cppcx/crt-functions-not-supported-in-universal-windows-platform-apps.md).

## Syntax

```cpp
int _outp(
   unsigned short port,
   int data_byte
);
unsigned short _outpw(
   unsigned short port,
   unsigned short data_word
);
unsigned long _outpd(
   unsigned short port,
   unsigned long data_word
);
```

### Parameters

*port*\
Port number.

*data_byte, data_word*\
Output values.

## Return Value

The functions return the data output. There's no error return.

## Remarks

The `_outp`, `_outpw`, and `_outpd` functions write a byte, a word, and a double word, respectively, to the specified output port. The *port* argument can be any unsigned integer in the range 0 - 65,535. *data_byte* can be any integer in the range 0 - 255. *data_word* can be any value in the range of an integer, an unsigned short integer, and an unsigned long integer, respectively.

Because these functions write directly to an I/O port, they can't be used in user-mode Windows code.

For information about using I/O ports in the Windows operating system, see [Serial Communications](/previous-versions/ff802693(v=msdn.10)).

The `outp` and `outpw` names are older, deprecated names for the `_outp` and `_outpw` functions. For more information, see [POSIX function names](../error-messages/compiler-warnings/compiler-warning-level-3-c4996.md#posix-function-names).
