# inp, _inp, inpw, _inpw, _inpd

Inputs, from a port, a byte (`inp`, `_inp`), a word (`inpw`, `_inpw`), or a double word (`_inpd`).

> [!IMPORTANT]
> These functions are obsolete. Beginning in Visual Studio 2015, they are not available in the CRT.\
> This API cannot be used in applications that execute in the Windows Runtime. For more information, see [CRT functions not supported in Universal Windows Platform apps](../cppcx/crt-functions-not-supported-in-universal-windows-platform-apps.md).

## Syntax

```cpp
int _inp(
   unsigned short port
);
unsigned short _inpw(
   unsigned short port
);
unsigned long _inpd(
   unsigned short port
);
```

### Parameters

*port*\
I/O port number.

## Return Value

The functions return the byte, word, or double word read from `port`. There's no error return.

## Remarks

The `_inp`, `_inpw`, and `_inpd` functions read a byte, a word, and a double word, respectively, from the specified input port. The input value can be any unsigned short integer in the range 0 - 65,535.

Because these functions read directly from an I/O port, they cannot be used in user code.

The `inp` and `inpw` names are older, deprecated names for the `_inp` and `_inpw` functions. For more information, see [POSIX function names](../error-messages/compiler-warnings/compiler-warning-level-3-c4996.md#posix-function-names).

## Requirements

|Routine|Required header|
|-------------|---------------------|
|`_inp`|\<conio.h>|
|`_inpw`|\<conio.h>|
|`_inpd`|\<conio.h>|

For more compatibility information, see [Compatibility](../c-runtime-library/compatibility.md).

## Libraries

All versions of the [C run-time libraries](../c-runtime-library/crt-library-features.md).
