# _get_printf_count_output

Indicates whether [printf, _printf_l, wprintf, _wprintf_l](printf-printf-l-wprintf-wprintf-l.md)-family functions support the **%n** format.

## Syntax

```C
int _get_printf_count_output();
```

## Return Value

Non-zero if **%n** is supported, 0 if **%n** is not supported.

## Remarks

If **%n** is not supported (the default), encountering **%n** in the format string of any of the **printf** functions will invoke the invalid parameter handler as described in [Parameter Validation](../../c-runtime-library/parameter-validation.md). If **%n** support is enabled (see [_set_printf_count_output](set-printf-count-output.md)) then **%n** will behave as described in [Format Specification Syntax: printf and wprintf Functions](../../c-runtime-library/format-specification-syntax-printf-and-wprintf-functions.md).

> [!IMPORTANT]
> Starting in Windows 10 version 2004 (build 19041), the `printf` family of functions prints exactly representable floating point numbers according to the IEEE 754 rules for rounding. In previous versions of Windows, exactly representable floating point numbers ending in '5' would always round up. IEEE 754 states that they must round to the closest even digit (also known as "Banker's Rounding"). For example, both `printf("%1.0f", 1.5)` and `printf("%1.0f", 2.5)` should round to 2. Previously, 1.5 would round to 2 and 2.5 would round to 3. This change only affects exactly representable numbers. For example, 2.35 (which, when represented in memory, is closer to 2.35000000000000008) continues to round up to 2.4. Rounding done by these functions now also respects the floating point rounding mode set by [`fesetround`](fegetround-fesetround2.md). Previously, rounding always chose `FE_TONEAREST` behavior. This change only affects programs built using Visual Studio 2019 version 16.2 and later. To use the legacy floating point rounding behavior, link with ['legacy_stdio_float_rounding.obj`](../link-options.md).
