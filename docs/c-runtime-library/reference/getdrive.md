# _getdrive

Gets the current disk drive.

> [!IMPORTANT]
> This API cannot be used in applications that execute in the Windows Runtime. For more information, see [CRT functions not supported in Universal Windows Platform apps](../../cppcx/crt-functions-not-supported-in-universal-windows-platform-apps.md).

## Syntax

```C
int _getdrive( void );
```

## Return Value

Returns the current (default) drive (1=A, 2=B, and so on). A return value of zero means that the current path doesn't start with a letter drive name, such as a UNC path. Or, it means that an internal buffer allocation failed. If an internal allocation fails, `errno` is set to ENOMEM.

## Remarks

By default, this function's global state is scoped to the application. To change this, see [Global state in the CRT](../global-state.md).

## Requirements

|Routine|Required header|
|-------------|---------------------|
|**_getdrive**|\<direct.h>|

For more compatibility information, see [Compatibility](../../c-runtime-library/compatibility.md).

## Example

```C
// crt_getdrive.c
// compile with: /c
// Illustrates drive functions including:
//    _getdrive       _chdrive        _getdcwd
//

#include <stdio.h>
#include <direct.h>
#include <stdlib.h>
#include <ctype.h>

int main( void )
{
   int ch, drive, curdrive;
   static char path[_MAX_PATH];

   // Save current drive.
   curdrive = _getdrive();

   printf( "Available drives are:\n" );

   // If we can switch to the drive, it exists.
   for( drive = 1; drive <= 26; drive++ )
   {
      if( !_chdrive( drive ) )
      {
         printf( "%c:", drive + 'A' - 1 );
         if( _getdcwd( drive, path, _MAX_PATH ) != NULL )
            printf( " (Current directory is %s)", path );
         putchar( '\n' );
      }
   }

   // Restore original drive.
   _chdrive( curdrive );
}
```

```Output
Available drives are:
A: (Current directory is A:\)
C: (Current directory is C:\)
E: (Current directory is E:\testdir\bin)
F: (Current directory is F:\)
G: (Current directory is G:\)
```
