A pointer to an array of character classification information.

## Remarks

The information in the character classification table is for internal use only, and is used by various functions that classify characters of type **`char`**. For more information, see the `Remarks` section of [_pctype, _pwctype, _wctype, _mbctype, _mbcasemap](../c-runtime-library/pctype-pwctype-wctype-mbctype-mbcasemap.md).

By default, this function's global state is scoped to the application. To change this, see [Global state in the CRT](global-state.md).
