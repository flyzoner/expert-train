# Base Classes

The inheritance process creates a new derived class that is made up of the members of the base class(es) plus any new members added by the derived class. In a multiple-inheritance, it is possible to construct an inheritance graph where the same base class is part of more than one of the derived classes. The following figure shows such a graph.

Multiple instances of a single base class

In the figure, pictorial representations of the components of `CollectibleString` and `CollectibleSortable` are shown. However, the base class, `Collectible`, is in `CollectibleSortableString` through the `CollectibleString` path and the `CollectibleSortable` path. To eliminate this redundancy, such classes can be declared as virtual base classes when they are inherited.
