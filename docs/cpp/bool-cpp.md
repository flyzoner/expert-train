# bool (C++)

This keyword is a built-in type. A variable of this type can have values [`true`](../cpp/true-cpp.md) and [`false`](../cpp/false-cpp.md). Conditional expressions have the type **`bool`** and so have values of type **`bool`**. For example, `i != 0` now has **`true`** or **`false`** depending on the value of `i`.

**Visual Studio 2017 version 15.3 and later** (Available with [/std:c++17](../build/reference/std-specify-language-standard-version.md) and later): The operand of a postfix or prefix increment or decrement operator may not be of type **`bool`**. In other words, given a variable `b` of type **`bool`**, these expressions are no longer allowed:

```cpp
    b++;
    ++b;
    b--;
    --b;
```

The values **`true`** and **`false`** have the following relationship:

```cpp
!false == true
!true == false
```

In the following statement:

```cpp
if (condexpr1) statement1;
```

If `condexpr1` is **`true`**, `statement1` is always executed; if `condexpr1` is **`false`**, `statement1` is never executed.

When a postfix or prefix **`++`** operator is applied to a variable of type **`bool`**, the variable is set to **`true`**.

**Visual Studio 2017 version 15.3 and later**: `operator++` for **`bool`** was removed from the language and is no longer supported.

The postfix or prefix **`--`** operator can't be applied to a variable of this type.

The **`bool`** type participates in default integral promotions. An r-value of type **`bool`** can be converted to an r-value of type **`int`**, with **`false`** becoming zero and **`true`** becoming one. As a distinct type, **`bool`** participates in overload resolution.
