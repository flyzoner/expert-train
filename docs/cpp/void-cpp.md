# void (C++)

When used as a function return type, the **`void`** keyword specifies that the function doesn't return a value. When used for a function's parameter list, **`void`** specifies that the function takes no parameters. When used in the declaration of a pointer, **`void`** specifies that the pointer is "universal."

If a pointer's type is `void*`, the pointer can point to any variable that's not declared with the **`const`** or **`volatile`** keyword. A `void*` pointer can't be dereferenced unless it's cast to another type. A `void*` pointer can be converted into any other type of data pointer.

In C++, a **`void`** pointer can point to a free function (a function that's not a member of a class), or to a static member function, but not to a non-static member function.

You can't declare a variable of type **`void`**.

## Example

```cpp
// void.cpp
void vobject;   // C2182
void *pv;   // okay
int *pint; int i;
int main() {
   pv = &i;
   // Cast optional in C required in C++
   pint = (int *)pv;
}
```
