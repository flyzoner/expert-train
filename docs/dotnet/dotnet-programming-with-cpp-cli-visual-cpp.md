# .NET programming with C++/CLI

::: moniker range="msvc-140"

By default, CLR projects created with Visual Studio 2015 target .NET Framework 4.5.2. You can target .NET Framework 4.6 when you create a new project. In the **New Project** dialog, change the target framework in the dropdown at the top middle of the dialog. To change the target framework for an existing project, close the project, edit the project file (*`.vcxproj`*), and change the value of the Target Framework Version to 4.6. The changes take effect the next time you open the project.

In Visual Studio 2017, the default target .NET Framework is 4.6.1. The Framework version selector is at the bottom of the **New Project** dialog.

C++/CLI itself isn't installed by default when you install a Visual Studio C++ workload. To install the component after Visual Studio is installed, open the Visual Studio Installer by selecting the Windows **Start** menu and searching for **visual studio installer**. Choose the **Modify** button next to your installed version of Visual Studio. Select the **Individual components** tab. Scroll down to the **Compilers, build tools, and runtimes** section, and select **C++/CLI support**. Select **Modify** to download the necessary files and update Visual Studio.
