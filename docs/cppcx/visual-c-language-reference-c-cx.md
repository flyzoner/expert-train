# C++/CX Language Reference

C++/CX is a set of extensions to the C++ language that enable the creation of Windows apps and Windows Runtime components in an idiom that is as close as possible to modern C++. Use C++/CX to write Windows apps and components in native code that easily interact with Visual C#, Visual Basic, and JavaScript, and other languages that support the Windows Runtime. In those rare cases that require direct access to the raw COM interfaces, or non-exceptional code, you can use the [Windows Runtime C++ Template Library (WRL)](./wrl/windows-runtime-cpp-template-library-wrl.md).

> [!NOTE]
> **[C++/WinRT](/windows/uwp/cpp-and-winrt-apis/index) is the recommended alternative to C++/CX**. It is a new, standard C++17 language projection for Windows Runtime APIs, available in the latest Windows SDK from version 1803 (10.0.17134.0) onward. C++/WinRT is implemented entirely in header files, and designed to provide you with first-class access to the modern Windows API.
>
> With C++/WinRT, you can both consume and author Windows Runtime APIs using any standards-conformant C++17 compiler. C++/WinRT typically performs better and produces smaller binaries than any other language option for the Windows Runtime. We will continue to support C++/CX and WRL, but highly recommend that new applications use C++/WinRT. For more information, see [C++/WinRT](/windows/uwp/cpp-and-winrt-apis/index).

By using C++/CX, you can create:

- C++ Universal Windows Platform (UWP) apps that use XAML to define the user interface and use the native stack. For more information, see [Create a "hello world" app in C++ (UWP)](/windows/uwp/get-started/create-a-basic-windows-10-app-in-cpp).

- C++ Windows Runtime components that can be consumed by JavaScript-based Windows apps. For more information, see [Creating Windows Runtime Components in C++](/windows/uwp/winrt-components/creating-windows-runtime-components-in-cpp).

- Windows DirectX games and graphics-intensive apps. For more information, see [Create a simple UWP Game with DirectX](/windows/uwp/gaming/tutorial--create-your-first-uwp-directx-game).
