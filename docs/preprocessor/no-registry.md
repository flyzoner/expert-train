# no_registry import attribute

**no_registry** tells the compiler not to search the registry for type libraries imported with `#import`.

## Syntax

> **#import** *type-library* **no_registry**

### Parameters

*type-library*\
A type library.

## Remarks

If a referenced type library isn't found in the include directories, the compilation fails even if the type library is in the registry.  **no_registry** propagates to other type libraries implicitly imported with `auto_search`.

The compiler never searches the registry for type libraries that are specified by file name and passed directly to `#import`.

When `auto_search` is specified, the additional `#import` directives are generated by using the **no_registry** setting of the initial `#import`. If the initial `#import` directive was **no_registry**, an `auto_search`-generated `#import` is also **no_registry**.

**no_registry** is useful if you want to import cross-referenced type libraries. It keeps the compiler from finding an older version of the file in the registry. **no_registry** is also useful if the type library isn't registered.
