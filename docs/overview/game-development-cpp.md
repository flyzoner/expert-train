# Game Development with C++

When you create a Universal Windows Platform (UWP) game, you have the opportunity to reach millions of players worldwide across phone, PC, and Xbox One. With Xbox on Windows, Xbox Live, cross-device multiplayer, an amazing gaming community, and powerful new features like the Universal Windows Platform (UWP) and DirectX 12, Windows games thrill players of all ages and genres. The new Universal Windows Platform (UWP) delivers compatibility for your game across Windows devices with a common API for phone, PC, and Xbox One, along with tools and options to tailor your game to each device experience.

Game development is documented on the [Windows Dev Center](/windows/uwp/gaming/getting-started).
