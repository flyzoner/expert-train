# C26457 USE_STD_IGNORE_INSTEAD_OF_VOID_CAST

Excerpt from the [C++ Core Guideline for this warning](https://github.com/isocpp/CppCoreGuidelines/blob/master/CppCoreGuidelines.md#es48-avoid-casts):

> Never cast to `(void)` to ignore a `[[nodiscard]]` return value. If you deliberately want to discard such a result, first think hard about whether that is really a good idea (there is usually a good reason the author of the function or of the return type used `[[nodiscard]]` in the first place). If you still think it's appropriate and your code reviewer agrees, use `std::ignore =` to turn off the warning which is simple, portable, and easy to grep.

```C++
struct S{};
[[nodiscard]] S getS();

void function() {
    (void) getS(); // C26457
    std::ignore = getS(); // OK
}
```
