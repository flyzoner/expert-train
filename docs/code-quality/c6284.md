# C6284

> warning C6284: object passed as parameter when string is required in call to \<function\>

This warning indicates that there is a mismatch between the format specifier and the type being used in a `printf`-style function.  The format specifier is a C style String type such as `%s` or `%ws`, and the argument matched with it is an object type.

This defect might produce incorrect output or crash.

This is frequently due to forgetting to convert an object string type such as `std::string`, `CComBSTR` or `bstr_t` into the C style string the `printf`-style function expects.  If this is the case then the fix is to add the appropriate conversion to the type.  This is needed because the parameters to `printf`-style functions are essentially untyped so no automatic conversion occurs.

## Example

```cpp
#include <atlbase.h>
#include <string>
#include <cstdlib>

void f()
{
  char buff[50];
  CComBSTR bstrValue{"Hello"};
  std::string str{"World"};

  // Oops, %ws and %s require C-style strings but CComBSTR and std::strings are being passed instead
  sprintf(buff,"%ws %s",bstrValue, str);
}
```

Fix the warning by adding the appropriate conversions:

```cpp
#include <atlbase.h>
#include <string>
#include <cstdlib>

void f()
{
  char buff[50];
  CComBSTR bstrValue{"Hello"};
  std::string str{"World"};

  // Fixed by adding a static_cast to the CComBSTR and calling c_str() on the std::string
  sprintf(buff,"%ws %s",static_cast<wchar_t*>(bstrValue), str.c_str());
}
```
