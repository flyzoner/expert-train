# C26461 USE_CONST_POINTER_ARGUMENTS:

The pointer argument '%argument%' for function '%function%' can be marked as a pointer to `const` (con.3).

A function with a `T*` argument has the potential to modify the value of the object. If that is not the intent of the function, it is better to make the pointer a `const T*` instead.

## Example

```cpp
struct MyStruct
{
    void MemberFn1() const;
    void MemberFn2();
};

void Function1_Helper(const MyStruct* myStruct);
void Function1(MyStruct* myStruct) // C26461, neither of the operations on myStruct would modify the pointer's value.
{
    if (!myStruct)
        return;

    myStruct->MemberFn1();      // The member function is const
    Function1_Helper(myStruct); // Function1_Helper takes a const
}

void Function2(MyStruct* myStruct)
{
    if (!myStruct)
        return;

    myStruct->MemberFn2(); // The member function is non-const, so no C26461 will be issued
}
```
