# C6302

> warning C6302: format string mismatch: character string passed as parameter \<number> when wide character string is required in call to \<function>

This warning indicates that the format string specifies a wide character string is expected. However, a character string is being passed. This will likely cause the output to be malformed or for the program to crash at runtime.

## Example

```cpp
#include <stdio.h>

void f()
{
  char buff[5] = "hi";

  // Oops, because this is wprintf, the %s format specifier will interpret the argument as a wide string.
  wprintf_s(L"%s", buff);
}
```

The following sample code uses `%hs` to specify a single-byte character string with `wprintf_s` function:

```cpp
#include <stdio.h>

void f()
{
  char buff[5] = "hi";

  // Use %hs format specifier so wprintf_s will interpret the argument correctly as a character string
  wprintf_s(L"%hs", buff);
}
```
