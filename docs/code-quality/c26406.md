# C26406  DONT_ASSIGN_RAW_TO_OWNER

This warning enforces R.3 from the C++ Core Guidelines. For more information, see [C++ Core Guidelines R.3](https://github.com/isocpp/CppCoreGuidelines/blob/master/CppCoreGuidelines.md#r3-a-raw-pointer-a-t-is-non-owning).

## Remarks

Owners are initialized from allocations or from other owners. This warning occurs when you assign a value from a raw pointer to an owner pointer. Raw pointers donâ€™t guarantee ownership transfer; the original owner may still hold the resource and attempt to release it. It's okay to assign a value from an owner to a raw pointer. Raw pointers are valid clients to access resources, but not to manage them.

## Example 1:  Using address of object

This sample attempts to assign ownership of the address of `defaultSocket` to owner pointer `socket`:

```cpp
gsl::owner<Socket*> socket = defaultSocket ? &defaultSocket : new Socket(); // C26406
```
