# C26433 OVERRIDE_EXPLICITLY

Function should be marked with `override`

## C++ Core Guidelines

[C.128: Virtual functions should specify exactly one of virtual, override, or final](https://github.com/isocpp/CppCoreGuidelines/blob/master/CppCoreGuidelines.md)

It's not required by the compiler to clearly state that a virtual function overrides its base. Not specifying `override` can cause subtle issues during maintenance if the virtual specification ever changes in the class hierarchy. It also lowers readability and makes an interface's polymorphic behavior less obvious. If a function is clearly marked as `override`, it enables the compiler to check consistency of the interface and help to spot issues before they manifest themselves at run time.

## Notes

1. This rule isn't applicable to destructors. Destructors have their own virtuality specifics.
1. The rule doesn't flag functions explicitly marked as `final`, which is itself a special variety of virtual specifier.
1. Warnings show up on function definitions, not declarations. It may be confusing, since definitions don't have virtual specifiers, but the warning is still correct.

## Example:  Implicit overriding

```cpp
class Shape {
public:
    virtual void Draw() = 0;
    // ...
};

class Ellipse : public Shape {
public:
    void Draw() { // C26433
        //...
    }
};
```
