# C26495 MEMBER_UNINIT

Variable '%variable%' is uninitialized. Always initialize a member variable (type.6).

## See also

C++ Core Guidelines [Type.6](https://github.com/isocpp/CppCoreGuidelines/blob/master/CppCoreGuidelines.md#SS-type) and [C.48](https://github.com/isocpp/CppCoreGuidelines/blob/master/CppCoreGuidelines.md#c48-prefer-in-class-initializers-to-member-initializers-in-constructors-for-constant-initializers)

## Example

```cpp
struct MyStruct
{
    int value;
    MyStruct() {}; // C26495, MyStruct::value is uninitialized
};
```

To fix the warning, add in-class initializers to all of the member variables. See the above linked C++ Core Guidelines pages for additional information.

```cpp
struct MyStruct
{
    int value{};
    MyStruct() {}; // no warning, MyStruct::value is set via default member initialization
};
```
