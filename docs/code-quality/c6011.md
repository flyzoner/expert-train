# C6011

> warning C6011: dereferencing NULL pointer \<name>

This warning indicates that your code dereferences a potentially null pointer. If the pointer value is invalid, the result is undefined. To resolve the issue, validate the pointer before use.

## Example

The following code generates this warning because a call to `malloc` might return null if insufficient memory is available:

```cpp
#include <malloc.h>

void f( )
{
  char *p = ( char * ) malloc( 10 );
  *p = '\0';

  // code ...
 free( p );
}
```

To correct this warning, examine the pointer for a null value as shown in the following code:

```cpp
#include <malloc.h>
void f( )
{
  char *p = ( char * )malloc ( 10 );
  if ( p )
  {
    *p = '\0';
    // code ...

    free( p );
  }
}
```

Functions may have parameters annotated by using the `Null` property in a `Pre` condition. Allocate memory inside these functions before you dereference the parameter. The following code generates warning C6011 because an attempt is made to dereference a null pointer (`pc`) inside the function without first allocating memory:

```cpp
#include <sal.h>
using namespace vc_attributes;
void f([Pre(Null=Yes)] char* pc)
{
  *pc='\0'; // warning C6011 - pc is null
  // code ...
}
```

The careless use of `malloc` and `free` leads to memory leaks and exceptions. To minimize these kinds of leaks and exception problems altogether, avoid allocating raw memory yourself. Instead, use the mechanisms provided by the C++ Standard Library (STL). These include [shared_ptr](../standard-library/shared-ptr-class.md), [unique_ptr](../standard-library/unique-ptr-class.md), and [vector](../standard-library/vector.md). For more information, see [Smart Pointers](../cpp/smart-pointers-modern-cpp.md) and [C++ Standard Library](../standard-library/cpp-standard-library-reference.md).
