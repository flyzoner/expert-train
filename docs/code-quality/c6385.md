# C6385

> warning C6385: invalid data: accessing *buffer-name*, the readable size is *size1* bytes, but *size2* bytes may be read: Lines: *x*, *y*

The readable extent of the buffer might be smaller than the index used to read from it. Attempts to read data outside the valid range leads to buffer overrun.

## Example

The following code generates this warning:

```cpp
void f(unsigned int i)
{
   char a[20];
   char j;
   if (i <= 20)  // C6385
   {
      j = a[i];
   }
}
```

To correct this warning, use the following code:

```cpp
void f(unsigned int i)
{
   char a[20];
   char j;
   if (i < 20)  // Okay
   {
      j = a[i];
   }
}
```
