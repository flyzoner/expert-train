# C28302

> warning C28302: For C++ reference-parameter <parameter_name>, an extra `_Deref_` operator was found on \<annotation>.

This warning is reported when an extra level of `_Deref_` is used on a parameter of a reference type such as `T &a`.  A common mistake when using SAL1 annotations is to use `__deref` on a reference type.  Reference types are understood by SAL so all annotations are already applied to the underlying type.  This is typically not an issue in SAL2 because the free-floating `__deref` annotation was removed.  If the intention is to apply an annotation to a sub-type then you should instead use the SAL2 `_AT_` or `_Outref_` annotations.

## Example

```cpp
// Oops, trying to apply __elem_writableTo to the pointer being referenced
void f( __deref __elem_writableTo(size) int *& buffer, int size);

void func()
{
  int buffer[100] = {};
  int *pbuffer = buffer;
  f(pbuffer, 100);
}
```

```cpp
// Fix warning switching to SAL2 syntax which has annotations that better describe what the function does.
void f( _Outref_result_buffer_(size) int *& buffer);
```
