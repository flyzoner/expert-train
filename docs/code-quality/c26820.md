# C26820

> Assigning by value when a const-reference would suffice, use const auto& instead (p.9).

For more information, see [P.9: Don't waste time or space](https://github.com/isocpp/CppCoreGuidelines/blob/master/CppCoreGuidelines.md#p9-dont-waste-time-or-space) in the C++ Core Guidelines.

This check covers non-obvious and easy-to-miss behavior when assigning a reference to a variable marked **`auto`**. The type of the **`auto`** variable is resolved to a value rather than a reference, and an implicit copy is made.

## Remarks

- This warning isn't raised for scalars, smart pointers, or views. It's also not raised for types whose size isn't more than twice the platform-dependent pointer size.
- This warning isn't raised when the variable gets mutated, as marking it `auto&` would introduce side-effects to the mutation.
- This warning isn't raised when the reference comes from a temporary object, because that results in a dangling reference. For example:

  ```cpp
  std::optional<int> TryGetNumber();
  ...
  const auto& val = TryGetNumber().value();
  val++; // Temporary from TryGetNumber() is destroyed and val is now dangling
  ```

## Example

This sample shows a variable definition that makes a potentially expensive copy when assigned a reference:

```cpp
const Object& MyClass::getRef() { ... }
...
auto ref = myclass.getRef(); // C26820 (`ref` takes a copy of the returned object)
```

To resolve this issue, declare the variable by using `const auto&` instead:

```cpp
const Object& MyClass::getRef() { ... }
...
const auto& ref = myclass.getRef(); // OK
```
