# C26483 STATIC_INDEX_OUT_OF_RANGE

Value %value% is outside the bounds (0, %bound%) of variable '%variable%'. Only index into arrays using constant expressions that are within bounds of the array (bounds.2).

## See also

[C++ Core Guidelines Bounds.2](https://github.com/isocpp/CppCoreGuidelines/blob/master/CppCoreGuidelines.md#SS-bounds)

## Example

```cpp
void function()
{
    std::array<int, 3> arr1 { 1, 2, 3 };
    arr1[3] = 4; // C26483, 3 is outside the bounds of the array

    int arr2[] { 1, 2, 3 };
    arr2[3] = 4; // C26483, 3 is outside the bounds of the array
}

```
