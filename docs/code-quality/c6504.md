# C6504

> warning C6504: invalid annotation: property may only be used on values of pointer, pointer-to-member, or array type

This warning indicates the use of a pointer-specific SAL annotation on a non-pointer data type. For more information about what data types are supported by properties, see [Annotation Properties](using-sal-annotations-to-reduce-c-cpp-code-defects.md).

## Example

```cpp
#include<sal.h>

class Point
{
public:
    //  members
};

// Oops, according to this annotation, pt may be null which does not make sense for a reference types
void f(_Pre_ _Maybenull_ Point& pt)
{
    // code ...
}

// Oops, according to this annotation, pt cannot be null which does not make sense for a reference types
void g(_Pre_ _Notnull_ Point& pt)
{
    // code ...
}
```

To correct this warning remove the annotation if it does not make sense.  You could also change to an annotation to be applicable to the type used, or change to type to match the annotation.

```cpp
#include<sal.h>

class Point
{
public:
    //  members
};

// Changed to pointer type because it may be null
void f(_Pre_ _Maybenull_  Point* pt)
{
    // code ...
}

// Removed annotation because it did not apply to reference types.
void g(Point& pt)
{
    // code ...
}
```
