# C26443 NO_EXPLICIT_DTOR_OVERRIDE

"Overriding destructor should not use explicit 'override' or 'virtual' specifiers."

This warning was removed in Visual Studio 16.8 to reflect [changes to C.128 in the C++ Core Guidelines](https://github.com/isocpp/CppCoreGuidelines/pull/1448).

## C++ Core Guidelines

[C.128: Virtual functions should specify exactly one of virtual, override, or final](https://github.com/isocpp/CppCoreGuidelines/blob/master/CppCoreGuidelines.md).

The current consensus on the Core Guidelines is to exclude destructors from the 'override explicitly' recommendation.

## Notes

- The rule flags overriding destructors that explicitly use 'virtual' or 'override' specifiers.
- Destructors can still use the 'final' specifier because of its special semantics.
- Warnings show up on function definitions, not declarations. It may be confusing, since definitions don't have virtual specifiers, but the warning is still appropriate.

## Example: Explicit 'override'

```cpp
class Transaction {
public:
    virtual ~Transaction();
    // ...
};

class DistributedTransaction : public Transaction {
public:
    ~DistributedTransaction() override { // C26443
        // ...
    }
};
```
