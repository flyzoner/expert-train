# C26438 NO_GOTO

"Avoid **`goto`**."

**C++ Core Guidelines**:\
[ES.76](https://github.com/isocpp/CppCoreGuidelines/blob/master/CppCoreGuidelines.md#es76-avoid-goto): Avoid goto

The use of **`goto`** is widely considered a dangerous and error-prone practice. It's acceptable only in generated code, such as in a parser generated from a grammar. With modern C++ features and utilities provided by the Guidelines Support Library, it should be easy to avoid **`goto`** altogether.

## Remarks

- This rule warns on any occurrence of **`goto`**, even if it happens in dead code, except template code that's never used and consequently ignored by compiler.
- Warnings can multiply when a macro contains **`goto`**. Current reporting mechanisms point to all instances where such a macro gets expanded. It can often be fixed in one place by changing the macro, or avoiding its use in favor of more maintainable mechanisms.

## Example

'goto clean-up' in macro

```cpp
#define ENSURE(E, L) if (!(E)) goto L;

void poll(connection &c)
{
    ENSURE(c.open(), end);                  // C26438

    while (c.wait())
    {
        connection::header h{};
        connection::signature s{};
        ENSURE(c.read_header(h), end);      // C26438
        ENSURE(c.read_signature(s), end);   // C26438
        // ...
    }

end:
    c.close();
}
```

'goto clean-up' in macro - replaced with gsl::finally

```cpp
void poll(connection &c)
{
    auto end = gsl::finally([&c] { c.close(); });

    if (!c.open())
        return;

    while (c.wait())
    {
        connection::header h{};
        connection::signature s{};
        if(!c.read_header(h))
            return;
       if(!c.read_signature(s))
            return;
        // ...
    }
}
```
