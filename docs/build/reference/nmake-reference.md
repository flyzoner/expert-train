# NMAKE Reference

The Microsoft Program Maintenance Utility (NMAKE.EXE) is a command-line tool included with Visual Studio. It builds projects based on commands that are contained in a description file, usually called a *makefile*.

NMAKE must run in a Developer Command Prompt window. A Developer Command Prompt window has the environment variables set for the tools, libraries, and include file paths required to build at the command line. For details on how to open a Developer Command Prompt window, see [Use the MSVC toolset from the command line](../building-on-the-command-line.md).
