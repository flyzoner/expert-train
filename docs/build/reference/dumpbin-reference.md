# DUMPBIN Reference

The Microsoft COFF Binary File Dumper (DUMPBIN.EXE) displays information about Common Object File Format (COFF) binary files. You can use DUMPBIN to examine COFF object files, standard libraries of COFF objects, executable files, and dynamic-link libraries (DLLs).

> [!NOTE]
> We recommend you run DUMPBIN from the Visual Studio command prompt. You can't start it from a system command prompt unless you set the environment correctly. For more information, see [Use the Microsoft C++ toolset from the command line](../building-on-the-command-line.md).

Only the [/HEADERS](headers.md) DUMPBIN option is available for use on files produced with the [/GL](gl-whole-program-optimization.md) compiler option.
