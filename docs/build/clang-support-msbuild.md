# Clang/LLVM support in Visual Studio projects

::: moniker range="<=msvc-150"

Clang support for both CMake and MSBuild projects is available in Visual Studio 2019.

::: moniker-end

::: moniker range=">=msvc-160"

You can use Visual Studio 2019 version 16.2 and later with Clang to edit, build, and debug C++ Visual Studio projects (MSBuild) that target Windows or Linux.

## Install

For best IDE support in Visual Studio, we recommend using the latest Clang compiler tools for Windows. If you don't already have the tools, you can install them by opening the Visual Studio Installer and choosing **C++ Clang tools for Windows** under **Desktop development with C++** optional components. You may prefer to use an existing Clang installation on your machine; if so, choose **C++ Clang-cl for v142 build tools**.

The Microsoft C++ Standard Library requires at least Clang 8.0.0.

Later versions of Visual Studio provide newer versions of the Clang toolset. The bundled version of Clang gets updated automatically to stay current with updates in the Microsoft implementation of the Standard Library. For example, Visual Studio 2019 version 16.9 includes Clang v11.

## Configure a Windows project to use Clang tools

To configure a Visual Studio project to use Clang, right-click on the project node in **Solution Explorer** and choose **Properties**. Typically, you should first choose **All configurations** at the top of the dialog. Then, under **General** > **Platform Toolset**, choose **LLVM (clang-cl)** and then **OK**.

If you're using the Clang tools that are bundled with Visual Studio, no extra steps are required. For Windows projects, Visual Studio by default invokes Clang in [clang-cl](https://llvm.org/devmtg/2014-04/PDFs/Talks/clang-cl.pdf) mode. It links with the Microsoft implementation of the Standard Library. By default, **clang-cl.exe** is located in *%VCINSTALLDIR%\\Tools\\Llvm\\bin\\* and *%VCINSTALLDIR%\\Tools\\Llvm\\x64\\bin\\*.

If you're using a custom Clang installation, you can either modify **Project** > **Properties** > **VC++ Directories** > **Configuration Properties** > **Executable Directories** by adding the custom Clang installation root as the first directory there, or change the value of the `LLVMInstallDir` property. For more information, see [Set a custom LLVM location](#custom_llvm_location).

## Configure a Linux project to use Clang tools

For Linux projects, Visual Studio uses the Clang GCC-compatible frontend. The project properties and nearly all compiler flags are identical

To configure a Visual Studio Linux project to use Clang:

1. Right-click on the project node in **Solution Explorer** and choose **Properties**.
1. Typically, you should first choose **All configurations** at the top of the dialog.
1. Under **General** > **Platform Toolset**, choose **Clang for Windows Subsystem for Linux** if you're using Windows Subsystem for Linux (WSL). Choose **Clang for Remote Linux** if you're using a remote machine or VM.
1. Press **OK**.

On Linux, Visual Studio by default uses the first Clang location that it finds in the PATH environment property. If you're using a custom Clang installation, then either change the value of the `LLVMInstallDir` property or else enter the path under **Project** > **Properties** > **Configuration Properties** > **VC++ DIrectories** > **Executable Directories**. For more information, see [Set a custom LLVM location](#custom_llvm_location).

## <a name="custom_llvm_location"></a> Set a custom LLVM location

You can set a custom path to LLVM for one or more projects by creating a *Directory.build.props* file. Then, add that file to the root folder of any project. You can add it to the root solution folder to apply it to all projects in the solution. The file should look like this (but use your actual LLVM path):

```xml
<Project>
  <PropertyGroup>
    <LLVMInstallDir>C:\MyLLVMRootDir</LLVMInstallDir>
  </PropertyGroup>
</Project>
```

You can combine this property with a custom LLVM toolset version. For more information, see [Set a custom LLVM toolset version](#custom_llvm_toolset).

## <a name="custom_llvm_toolset"></a> Set a custom LLVM toolset version

Starting in Visual Studio 2019 version 16.9, you can set a custom toolset version for LLVM. To set this property in a project in Visual Studio:

1. Open the project's **Property Pages** dialog box. For details, see [Set C++ compiler and build properties in Visual Studio](./working-with-project-properties.md).

1. Select the **Configuration Properties** > **General** property page.

1. Modify the **Platform Toolset** property to *LLVM (clang-cl)*, if it isn't already set.

1. Select the **Configuration Properties** > **Advanced** property page.

1. Modify the **LLVM Toolset Version** property to your preferred version, and then choose **OK** to save your changes.

The **LLVM Toolset Version** property only appears when the LLVM platform toolset is selected.

You can set the toolset version for one or more projects by creating a *Directory.build.props* file. Then, add that file to the root folder of any project. Add it to the root solution folder to apply it to all projects in the solution. The file should look like this (but use your actual LLVM path):

```xml
<Project>
  <PropertyGroup>
    <LLVMToolsVersion>11.0.0</LLVMToolsVersion>
  </PropertyGroup>
</Project>
```

You can also combine this property with a custom LLVM location. For example, your *Directory.build.props* file could look like:

```xml
<Project>
  <PropertyGroup>
    <LLVMInstallDir>C:\MyLLVMRootDir</LLVMInstallDir>
    <LLVMToolsVersion>11.0.0</LLVMToolsVersion>
  </PropertyGroup>
</Project>
```

When you add a *Directory.build.props* file, the settings appear as the default in the project Property Pages dialog. However, changes to these properties in Visual Studio override the settings in the *Directory.build.props* file.

## Set additional properties, edit, build, and debug

After you have set up a Clang configuration, right-click again on the project node and choose **Reload project**. You can now build and debug the project using the Clang tools. Visual Studio detects that you're using the Clang compiler and provides IntelliSense, highlighting, navigation, and other editing features. Errors and warnings are displayed in the **Output Window**. The project property pages for a Clang configuration are similar to the ones for MSVC. However, some compiler-dependent features such as Edit and Continue aren't available for Clang configurations. You can set a Clang compiler or linker option that isn't available in the property pages. Add it manually in the property pages under **Configuration Properties** > **C/C++ (or Linker)** > **Command Line** > **Additional Options**.

When debugging, you can use breakpoints, memory and data visualization, and most other debugging features.
