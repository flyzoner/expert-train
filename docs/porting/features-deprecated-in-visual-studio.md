# C++ features deprecated in Visual Studio 2019

- Support for Windows XP development

  Visual Studio 2019 and later does not include support for creating code for Windows XP by using the v142 toolset. Support for Windows XP development by using the v141 toolset that shipped in Visual Studio 2017 is available as an optional component in the Visual Studio Installer. For information on how to install the v141 Windows XP platform toolset, see [Configuring programs for Windows XP](../build/configuring-programs-for-windows-xp.md).
