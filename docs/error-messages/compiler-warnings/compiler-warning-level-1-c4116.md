# Compiler Warning (level 1) C4116

unnamed type definition in parentheses

A structure, union, or enumerated type with no name is defined in a parenthetical expression. The type definition is meaningless.

In a C function call, the definition has global scope. In a C++ function call, the definition has the same scope as the function being called.
