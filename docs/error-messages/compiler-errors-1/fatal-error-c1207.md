# Fatal Error C1207

Managed templates not supported by the version of the runtime installed

C1207 occurs when you have a compiler for the current release, but a common language runtime from a previous release.

Some functionality of the compiler may not work on a previous version of the run time.

To resolve C1207 install the common language runtime version that is intended for use with your compiler.
