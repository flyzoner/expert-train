# Fatal Error C1209

Friend assemblies not supported by the version of the runtime installed

C1208 occurs when you have a compiler for the current release, but a common language runtime from a previous release.

Some functionality of the compiler may not work on a previous version of the run time.

To resolve C1209, install the common language runtime that shipped with the compiler you are using.

For more information, see [Friend Assemblies (C++)](../../dotnet/friend-assemblies-cpp.md).
