# Fatal Error C1211

The TypeForwardedTo Custom Attribute is not supported by the version of the runtime installed

C1211 occurs when you have a compiler for the current release, but a common language runtime from a previous release.

Some functionality of the compiler may not work on a previous version of the run time.

To resolve C1211 install the common language runtime that shipped with the compiler you are using.

For more information, see [Type Forwarding (C++/CLI)](../../extensions/type-forwarding-cpp-cli.md).
