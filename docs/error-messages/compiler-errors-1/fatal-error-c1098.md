# Fatal Error C1098

Version mismatch with Edit and Continue engine

The debugger version you are using does not match the compiler used to create the executable. If recompiling does not fix the problem, you may need to reinstall Visual C++ to make sure you have the proper versions of the debugger and compiler.
