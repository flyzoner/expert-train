## General

| Property | Description | Choices |
|--|--|--|
| Additional Include Directories | Specifies one or more directories to add to the include path. Use semi-colons to separate multiple directories. (-I\[path]). |
| Debug Information Format | Specifies the type of debugging information generated by the compiler. | **None** - Produces no debugging information, so compilation may be faster.<br/>**Minimal Debug Information** - Generate minimal debug information.<br/>**Full Debug Information (DWARF2)** - Generate DWARF2 debug information.<br/> |
| Object File Name | Specifies a name to override the default object file name. It can be a file or directory name. (-o [name]). |
| Warning Level | Selects how strict you want the compiler to be about code errors.  Add other flags directly to **Additional Options**. (/w, /Weverything). | **Turn Off All Warnings** - Disables all compiler warnings.<br/>**EnableAllWarnings** - Enables all warnings, including ones disabled by default.<br/> |
| Treat Warnings As Errors | Treats all compiler warnings as errors. For a new project, it may be best to use /Werror in all compilations. Resolve all warnings to ensure the fewest possible hard-to-find code defects. |
| C Additional Warnings | Defines a set of additional warning messages. |
| C++ Additional Warnings | Defines a set of additional warning messages. |
| Enable Verbose mode | When Verbose mode is enabled, prints out more information to diagnose the build. |
| C Compiler | Specifies the program to invoke during compilation of C source files, or the path to the C compiler on the remote system. |
| C++ Compiler | Specifies the program to invoke during compilation of C++ source files, or the path to the C++ compiler on the remote system. |
| Compile Timeout | Remote compilation timeout, in milliseconds. |
| Copy Object Files | Specifies whether to copy the compiled object files from the remote system to the local machine. |
| Max Parallel Compilation Jobs | The number of processes to create in parallel during compilation. The default is 1. If you're using Windows Subsystem for Linux (WSL) version 1, the limit is 64. |
| Validate Architecture | Specify whether to check if the platform the project targets matches the remote system.|
| Enable Address Sanitizer | Compile the program with Address Sanitizer, which is a fast memory error detector that can find runtime memory issues such as use-after-free, and perform out of bounds checks.|

## Optimization

| Property | Description | Choices |
|--|--|--|
| Optimization | Specifies the optimization level for the application. | **Custom** - Custom optimization.<br/>**Disabled** - Disable optimization.<br/>**Minimize Size** - Optimize for size.<br/>**Maximize Speed** - Optimize for speed.<br/>**Full Optimization** - Expensive optimizations. |
| Strict Aliasing | Assumes the strictest aliasing rules.  An object of one type is never assumed to have the same address as an object of a different type. |
| Unroll Loops | Unrolls loops to make the application faster by reducing the number of branches executed, at the cost of larger code size. |
| Link Time Optimization | Enables inter-procedural optimizations by allowing the optimizer to look across object files in your application. |
| Omit Frame Pointer | Suppresses creation of frame pointers on the call stack. |
| No Common Blocks | Allocates even uninitialized global variables in the data section of the object file, rather than generate them as common blocks. |

## Preprocessor

| Property | Description |
|--|--|
| Preprocessor Definitions | Defines preprocessing symbols for your source file. (-D) |
| Undefine Preprocessor Definitions | Specifies one or more preprocessor undefines.  (-U \[macro]) |
| Undefine All Preprocessor Definitions | Undefines all previously defined preprocessor values.  (-undef) |
| Show Includes | Generates a list of include files with compiler output.  (-H) |

## Code Generation

| Property | Description | Choices |
|--|--|--|
| Position Independent Code | Generates position-independent code (PIC) for use in a shared library. |
| Statics are thread safe | Emits extra code to use routines specified in the C++ ABI for thread-safe initialization of local statics. | **No** - Disable thread-safe statics.<br/>**Yes** - Enable thread-safe statics. |
| Floating Point Optimization | Enables floating-point optimizations by relaxing IEEE-754 conformance. |
| Inline Methods Hidden | When enabled, out-of-line copies of inline methods are declared `private extern`. |
| Symbols Hidden By Default | All symbols are declared `private extern` unless explicitly marked for export by using the `__attribute` macro. |
| Enable C++ Exceptions | Specifies the exception-handling model used by the compiler. | **No** - Disable exception handling.<br/>**Yes** - Enable exception handling. |

## Language

| Property | Description | Choices |
|--|--|--|
| Enable Run-Time Type Information | Adds code for checking C++ object types at run time (runtime type information).     (frtti, fno-rtti) |
| C Language Standard | Determines the C language standard. | **Default**<br/>**C89** - C89 Language Standard.<br/>**C99** - C99 Language Standard.<br/>**C11** - C11 Language Standard.<br/>**C99 (GNU Dialect)** - C99 (GNU Dialect) Language Standard.<br/>**C11 (GNU Dialect)** - C11 (GNU Dialect) Language Standard. |
| C++ Language Standard | Determines the C++ language standard. | **Default**<br/>**C++03** - C++03 Language Standard.<br/>**C++11** - C++11 Language Standard.<br/>**C++14** - C++14 Language Standard.<br/>**C++03 (GNU Dialect)** - C++03 (GNU Dialect) Language Standard.<br/>**C++11 (GNU Dialect)** - C++11 (GNU Dialect) Language Standard.<br/>**C++14 (GNU Dialect)** - C++14 (GNU Dialect) Language Standard. |

## Advanced

| Property | Description | Choices |
|--|--|--|
| Compile As | Selects compilation language option for .c and .cpp files. (-x c, -x c++) | **Default** - Detect based on the .c or .cpp extension.<br/>**Compile as C Code** - Compile as C code.<br/>**Compile as C++ Code** - Compile as C++ code. |
| Forced Include Files | Specifies one or more forced include files (-include \[name]) |
