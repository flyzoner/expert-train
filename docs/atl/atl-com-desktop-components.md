# ATL COM Desktop Components

The ATL Reference documents the Active Template Library (ATL), a set of template-based C++ classes that simplify the programming of Component Object Model (COM) objects. COM is a binary specification for creating and consuming software components on Windows. To fully take advantage of ATL, a working familiarity with COM is highly recommended. For more information about COM, see [Component Object Model (COM)](/windows/win32/com/component-object-model--com--portal).
