# Creating an ATL Project

The easiest way to create an ATL project is to use the ATL Project Wizard, located in the **Win32 Projects** folder of the **New Project** dialog box.

## To create an ATL project using the ATL Project Wizard

1. In Visual Studio, choose **File > New > Project** from the main menu.

1. Select the **ATL Project** icon in the **Templates** pane to open the **ATL Project Wizard**.

1. Define your application settings using the [Application Settings](../../atl/reference/application-settings-atl-project-wizard.md) page of the **ATL Project Wizard**.

   > [!NOTE]
   > Skip this step to keep the wizard default settings.

1. Click **Finish** to close the wizard and open your new project in the development environment.

Once your project is created, you can view the files created in **Solution Explorer**. For more information about the files the wizard creates for your project, see the project-generated file ReadMe.txt. For more information about the file types, see [File Types Created for Visual Studio C++ projects](../../build/reference/file-types-created-for-visual-cpp-projects.md). For more information about the configurations for the new ATL project, and how to change them, see [Default ATL Project Configurations](../../atl/reference/default-atl-project-configurations.md).
