# &lt;charconv&gt;

Quickly convert a character sequence to an integer or floating-point value, and the other way around.
One way to use this library is to write and roundtrip floating-point values in JSON and text files.

The conversion functions are tuned for performance, and also support shortest-round-trip behavior. Shortest-round-trip behavior means when a number is converted to chars, only enough precision is written out to enable recovering the original number when converting those chars back to a floating-point. No other CRT or STL function provides this capability.

Some of the benefits of using the `<charconv>` library are:

- The sequence of chars representing a numeric value doesn't need to be null-terminated. Likewise, when a number is converted to chars, the result isn't null-terminated.
- Conversion functions don't allocate memory. You own the buffer in all cases.
- Conversion functions don't throw. They return a structure that contains error information.
- Conversions aren't runtime rounding-mode sensitive.
- Conversions aren't locale aware. They always print and parse decimal points as '.' never as ',' for locales that use commas.
