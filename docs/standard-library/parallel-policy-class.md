# parallel_policy Class

Used as a unique type to disambiguate parallel algorithm overloading and indicate that a parallel algorithmâ€™s execution may be parallelized.

## Syntax

```cpp
class execution::parallel_policy;
```

## Remarks

During the execution of a parallel algorithm with the `execution::parallel_policy` policy, if the invocation of an element access function exits via an uncaught exception, `terminate()` shall be called.
