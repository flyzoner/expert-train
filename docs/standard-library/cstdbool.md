# &lt;cstdbool&gt;

Includes the C standard library header \<stdbool.h> and adds the associated names to the `std` namespace.

> [!NOTE]
> Because the \<stdbool.h> header defines macros that are keywords in C++, including it has no effect. The \<stdbool.h> header is deprecated in C++. The \<cstdbool> header is deprecated in C++17 and removed in the draft C++20 standard.

## Requirements

**Header:** \<cstdbool>

**Namespace:** std

## Remarks

Including this header ensures that the names declared using external linkage in the C standard library header are declared in the `std` namespace.
