# &lt;ccomplex&gt;

Includes the C++ standard library header [\<complex>](complex.md).

> [!NOTE]
> The C standard library \<complex.h> header isn't included by \<ccomplex>, because it's effectively replaced by the C++ overloads in \<complex> and \<cmath>. That makes the \<ccomplex> header redundant. The \<complex.h> header is deprecated in C++. The \<ccomplex> header is deprecated in C++17 and removed in the draft C++20 standard.

## Requirements

**Header:** \<ccomplex>

**Namespace:** std

## Remarks

The name `clog`, which is declared in \<complex.h>, isn't defined in the `std` namespace because of potential conflicts with the `clog` that's declared in [\<iostream>](iostream.md).
