# Creating an OLE DB Consumer

::: moniker range=">=msvc-160"

The ATL OLE DB Consumer wizard is not available in Visual Studio 2019 and later. You can still add the functionality manually. For more information, see [Creating a Consumer Without Using a Wizard](creating-a-consumer-without-using-a-wizard.md).

You can create an OLE DB Templates consumer with or without the **ATL OLE DB Consumer Wizard**, though using the wizard is the recommended method. A consumer can operate in any application that supports ATL.
