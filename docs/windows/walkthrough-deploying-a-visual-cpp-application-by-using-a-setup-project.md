# Walkthrough: Deploying a Visual C++ Application By Using a Setup Project

Describes how to use a setup project to deploy a Visual C++ application.

## Prerequisites

You need the following components to complete this walkthrough:

- A computer with Visual Studio installed.

- An additional computer that doesn't have the Visual C++ libraries.

## Create the setup project

Instructions for creating a setup project vary depending on which version of Visual Studio you have installed. To see the documentation for your preferred version of Visual Studio, use the **Version** selector control. It's found at the top of the table of contents on this page.

### To create the project in Visual Studio 2019

1. On the menu bar, choose **File** > **New** > **Project** to open the **Create a New Project** dialog box.

1. At the top of the dialog, type `MFC` in the search box and then choose **MFC App** from the results list. If you do not see it, you will need to launch the Visual Studio Installer program from the Windows Start menu and click on the **C++ Desktop Development workload** tile. Under **Individual Components**, ensure that the MFC component is checked.

1. In the next page, enter a name for the project, and specify the project location if desired.

1. Choose the **Create** button to create the client project. When the **MFC Application Wizard** appears, accept all the defaults.

1. Change the active solution configuration to **Release**. From the **Build** menu, select **Configuration Manger**. From the **Configuration Manager** dialog box, select **Release** from the **Active solution configuration** drop-down box. Click **Close**.

1. Press **Ctrl**+**Shift**+**B** to build the application. Or, on the **Build** menu, click **Build Solution**. Building the application enables the setup project to use the output of this MFC application project.

1. If you haven't already done so, download the Microsoft Visual Studio Installer Projects extension. The extension is free for Visual Studio developers and adds the functionality of the setup and deployment project templates to Visual Studio. When you're connected to the Internet, in Visual Studio, choose **Extensions** > **Manage Extensions**. Under the **Extensions and Updates** dialog, select the **Online** tab and type *Microsoft Visual Studio Installer Projects* in the search box. Press **Enter**, select **Microsoft Visual Studio \<version> Installer Projects**, and click **Download**. Choose to run and install the extension, then restart Visual Studio.

   ![The Manage Extensions dialog showing the Visual Studio setup project extension.](media/vs2019-extension-dialog-installer-project.png "Name the client project")

1. On the Visual Studio menu bar, choose **File** > **Recent Projects and Solutions**, and then choose to reopen your project.

1. On the menu bar, choose **File** > **New** > **Project** to open the **Create a New Project** dialog box. In the search box, type "Setup" and from the results list choose **Setup Project**.

1. Enter a name for the setup project in the **Name** box. In the **Solution** drop-down list, select **Add to solution**. Choose the **OK** button to create the setup project. A **File Assistant (ProjectName)** tab opens in the editor window.

A new item named **Shortcut to Primary Output from ProjectName (Active)** appears. You may rename the shortcut item, then drag and drop the item into the **User's Programs Menu** node on the left side of the window.

1. On the menu bar, choose **Build** > **Configuration Manager**. In the **Project** table, under the **Build** column, check the box for the deployment project. Click **Close**.
